# Four-Castors-Dashboard
The Four-Castors-Dashboard is an app that allows you to see what the current and expected weather is going to be in your location and many other locations you are interested in seeing. It also allows you to save locations to allow easy access to your most frequented places you either visit, live or vacation to.

## Our Mission
We wanted to make an easy to use app that allows you to save locations to get current and expected weathering reports.

## Application Requirements
** - Site runs perfectly fine on local host. Heroku has issues reading the API's both google autocomplete and the openweathermap components. API keys are broken within Heroku, to see full functionality run on local host.

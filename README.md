# Four-Castors-Dashboard
The Four-Castors-Dashboard is an app that allows you to see what the current and expected weather is going to be in your location and many other locations you are interested in seeing. It also allows you to save locations to allow easy access to your most frequented places you either visit, live or vacation to.

## Our Mission
We wanted to make an easy to use app that allows you to save locations to get current and expected weathering reports.

## Application Requirements
** - Site runs perfectly fine on local host. Heroku has issues reading the API's both google autocomplete and the openweathermap components. API keys are broken within Heroku, to see full functionality run on local host.

**Use React for the front end.

**Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

**Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

**Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

**Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

**Have a polished UI.

**Be responsive.

**Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

**Include authentication (JWT).

**Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

**Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).

**Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

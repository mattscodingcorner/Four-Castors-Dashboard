# Four-Castors-Dashboard
The Four-Castors-Dashboard is an app that allows you to see what the current and expected weather is going to be in your location and many other locations you are interested in seeing. It also allows you to save locations to allow easy access to your most frequented places you either visit, live or vacation to.
